            <div class="body-text">The IATSE Safety App plays a vital role in production crews being able to establish and maintain safe sets. The app provides users with safety information particular to their union locals (geographic areas of work) and also allows hazardous circumstances to be reported anonymously. The current app's design fails to inspire confidence in its user base, resulting in on-set hazards going unreported on many occasions while safety information is acquired by alternate, often slower and unreliable means. The challenge was to create a design that could make the app a primary tool in any production worker’s arsenel.</div>

            <div class="body-text">Using both the heuristic evaluation and storyboards as guides I came up with a few tasks for third parties to complete over video call. These tasks varied in completion difficulty and were formulated to gauge how quickly certain types of information could be found.

Though this information appears to present a productive and informed app, users found it caused navigation difficulty. The most popular concerns were:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">A lack of hierarchy on the homepage making discovery of priority information less intuitive and more time consuming.</li>

            <div class="body-text">Although we understood how the user base felt about safety on set, it was still crucial that we understood why users would turn to the IATSE Safety app instead of accomplishing their needs by other means. A synthesis of my research into emotional/mental pain-points as well as scenario storyboarding provided me with the following:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">Users need to feel confident in the information they seek and find.</li>

            <div class="body-text">Knowing the ‘why’ meant efforts could now be focused on how the app could be improved in order for the user to better achieve their goals. Having looked at where users struggled during user tests pain points were revealed in the following areas:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">The current one page solution for the homepage is cluttered and not intuitive, thereby reducing productivity.</li>

            <div class="body-text">Letting the user know that the app was following their search decisions was a crucial mode of feedback. In the existing app the user had to hope what they searched for would return a result on a new page and if there were no results, an extra interaction had to occur by going back and trying again. Users often quit searching all together. Overhauling the search function meant providing the user with auto populating search results and suggestions for search queries. A bookmarking feature would allow users to save sources of information most relevant to them.</div>

            <div class="body-text">The existing visual language didn't provide the clarity that was necessary for the app to be a primary resource of consultation amongst users and ultimately led to users looking elsewhere for information. Implementing predictability and clearly communicating information through visual cues and a familiar user interface came down to the following:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">A bolder, more spaced out layout with larger, clearly labeled and colored buttons (taps, fields).</li>
                    <li class="list-item">A tabbed interface splitting the app into two areas, separating priority resources (hazard form and safety numbers) from secondary functions (searching and bookmarking topics).</li>

New interactions could be experimented with in order to gauge overall intuitiveness. Wireframes could also be shared with others to receive feedback.</div>

            <div class="body-text">The prototype encompassed most of what I had attempted to accomplish throughout the design process. Larger tiles on the home screen provided access to important information, made easily accessible for urgent situations. This anchored the primary function of the app while the search feature offered personalization and a home for more casual use. The two-tab build also meant future iterations could expand on this layout in a modular form.</div>

            <div class="slide-heading-secondary">Focusing on simplicity.</div>
            <div class="body-text">The redesign was a blank slate that could have been taken in many directions. I found myself envisioning multiple feature sets and visual approaches early on in the process and at a certain point had to step back and reevaluate what the app was being redesigned for. It took some time but reframing my approach to "making the existing experience, function and form, easier" was a key factor in completing this project.</div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary medium-top-spacing">There is more work to do.</div>
            <div class="body-text">One of the areas that still bugs me is the article view. When a user selects an article from a search, the current app displays the article as a document, like viewing a pdf. Zooming in is required to even read the documents. To come up with an all-encompassing solution to displaying documents would require accessing every document made available within the app, across multiple locals. This is a problem that is going to require more thought so I'll let you know when I've cracked it.</div>
